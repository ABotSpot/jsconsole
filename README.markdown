# JS Console

A JavaScript web console, useful for quick experimentation, debugging, presentations (for live coding) and workshops.

# Features

- Resizable font (yep, biggest issue with Firebug in workshops)
- shift + up/down for bigger console

# Done

- Save history (easy)
- Add support for loading in a DOM (not so easy) (YQL - I thank you again)
- Permalink to individual execs (easy)

# TODO

- Permalink to session (trickier, server side required - can I do it without?)
